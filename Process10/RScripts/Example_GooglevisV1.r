calculated as the maximum correlation within a 400bp window over the correlation observed at the read length distance. Cross-coverage similarly looks at the relationship between reads on either

strand or distance. This results in every peak being associated with at least 1 gene. The number of peaks landing within 2000bp extended genes and the number of extended genes found to contain a peak are seen in Table4",br=T,p)
